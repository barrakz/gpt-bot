# gpt-bot

The code script utilizes OpenAI API and GPT-3 language model for question-answering. It defines a helper function ask_gpt3 to interact with OpenAI API, and checks the connection with OpenAI using openai.Model.list(). Users can input questions to receive answers from GPT-3 in a while loop. If an error occurs during the question-answering process, the script will print the corresponding error message.
